Hello deer reader,

You have scrolled down enough to see this, my, first post. How are you and did you like my wildlife pun? You know, I always ask: 

> "Who is the reader?"

but not: 

> "How is the reader?"

so I thought I'd might as well change it. I am trying to look at grammar and stuff... no promises tho! And if you're a teacher reading this (because I did make this site bc of school reasons, no clue for what *yet*) I am somewhat sorry for what you're going to see on here. Alright I'll stop talking (writing? (am I the voice in your head right now?)) now and continue actually particip8ing in class or so... see ya around!
