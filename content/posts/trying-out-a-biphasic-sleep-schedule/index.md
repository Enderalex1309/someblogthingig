Hello Dear Reader,

If you have ever spent any amount of time with me in person then you know that I'm often very tired. Why is still a mystery to many and trying to fix it is,,, well it hasn't really worked. Especially recently my sleep schedule has been not optimal as no matter how early I go to sleep I only get 4h-6h of sleep. Yes, when I go to sleep at midnight I wake up at 5am and when I go to bed at 3am I wake up at around 9am (it's a real problem). So in order to try and fix that I will no londer try to fight it (and force myself to sleep longer when I wake up too early) and just go with it I guess. 

This might be a health issue, I don't know and should probably go to a doctor but eh. Stress also adds to it I think which is always lovely. I already have trouble falling asleep and I do take medication to help with that, when I should be awake though (in any lesson at school for example) I can fall asleep as if it's the only thing I'm capable of. What's also going to be interesting health wise is how this is going to affect my chronic pain that gets worse during certain times a day. 

How am I going to try and solve this issue you might ask and well do I have the answer for you right here: a biphasic sleep schedule. Now I'm to lazy to explain this all to you so here's the [Wikipedia article about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep) and a summary made by ChatGPT about it:

> Polyphasic sleep is a non-traditional sleep pattern involving multiple short sleep sessions throughout the day and night, replacing the typical single long nighttime sleep. Advocates suggest it can enhance productivity by reducing total sleep time, but its effectiveness and safety remain a subject of debate among experts. While some individuals may adapt to polyphasic sleep, it may not be suitable for everyone, and it's important to consider potential health risks before attempting such sleep schedules.

Now that you've been enlightened as well, here are the things I'm hoping to achieve with this:

* Not being tired all day
* Feeling like I have more freetime
* Being more productive in the time I'm awake
* Living a more fullfilling life

My plan is it to go to sleep right after I get home from school, wake up sometime for dinner and the go to sleep again when I have enough time to make up the optimal 7-9 hours. This way I can maintain a social life and still try out this little experiment.

### Questions I asked myself during this expreiment *(& my conclusion)*

How do I sleep at sleepovers if I keep this up?  *Just don't expect good sleep at a sleepover, drop if for that day or sleep for a bit - whatever feels right in the moment!*

What do I do at afterschool events where I don't have time to go home?  *Sleep when you have the time or eat/drink something that will keep you awake and then go to sleep early*

How healthy is this in the longrun?  *Getting not enough deep sleep isn't all that healthy as your body needs to rest and that often can't really happen in a 1-3 hour sleep.* 

When do I take my medication I would usually take before going to sleep?  *Before the longer sleeping period or closest to the time where you usually take it.* 

### The Log

`6 Nov 2023`

I'm actually tired before going to bed a second time! I did get some of my energy back even though I didn't sleep very deeply after coming home from school. I think that's probably just something my body has to get adjusted to. I wasn't very productive after waking up as I was on call with a friend and then started overthinking and then it was time for bed again. The time I have after waking up a second time is very limited I have realized so I should use it wisely (I sound like a wizard). I was honestly not too tired after waking up either and started getting tired when bed-time-2 was on the menu so thats pretty good so far. I'm mostly stressing out about the two tests I'll have write in two days (!!) and hope that this helps me study somehow.

`7 Nov 2023`

Sooo it's currently 01:29 am and I finally finished studying for my biology test. Whats surprising to me is that I still have enough time before bed to write this. Okay but let's start at the beginning - so i woke up, pretty awake and then did the mistake (or habit) of just going back to sleep. When i woke up like half an hour later I was in pain. I took my medication and was fine,,, for a moment. The pain stayed in varying intensity during the whole day. This is probably because my body isn't adapted to this schedule yet and my chronic pain gets worse when I do something different than my inner-body-schedule. Around 2 pm I got a little tired but I couldn't just go to sleep. That vanished when I returned home even though I got home kind of late, which is why I showered and ate dinner **before** going to sleep. When I went to sleep it was about 6:30 pm and I woke up around 7:30 pm because my mom wanted to talk to me. Then I went to sleep again as I wanted to wake up naturally. I woke up at around 10:30 pm (kind of late if you ask me) and I wasn't motivated at all. When I opened Whatsapp I saw that many of my friends were online and talking while I was sleeping and now, as I'm awake, they're all going to bed. This isn't much of a problem when I go to bed earlier though (I hope). As I mentioned earlier I was pretty productive though. This is good because it proves that this sleeping rhythm does have some advantages.

I naturally woke up at 6 am (half an hour before my alarm rings). I didn't fall asleep in german class! Even though I got tired around 2 pm it wasn't enough to sleep. When I got home I really didn't want to go to sleep but I did anyways and kind of slept for an hour. Also pretty much no pain today! I do however feel my head, kind of like a headache but not because it's not actual pain... well anyways I'm going to sleep earlier today.

`9 Nov 2023`

You can guess what happened at 6 am today - if you guessed that I woke up you'd be correct. I actually didn't get tired at 2 pm nor when I got home which is probably why I only got 30 mins of sleep. I went to bed sometime after 11 pm.

`10 Nov 2023`

For some reason I woke up at like 3:40 am. It wasn't anything like pain that woke me up so i just went back to sleep. Chronic illness has been showing itself in a little bit of pain and some other symptoms this week which might also be  because of the stress I've had this week.

### Conclusion

Cutting out freetime with sleeping just so I can do my work better isn't motivating. However - after waking up I do work better, so this is definitely not the last time I'm doing this. After the body adapts to the new rhythm I was fine (if we ignore the fact I could feel my head through the entire week). Towards the end I got less tired during the day - my sleep went from 2-4h down to 30 minutes of mediocre sleep because I didn't need it I guess. What I learned is that I should sleep when I'm tired and if it's inconvenient timing, just break up the eight hours into pieces because no amount of school work is easier when tired and worth staying up for.
