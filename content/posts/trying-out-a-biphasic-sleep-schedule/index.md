Hello Dear Reader,

If you have ever spent any amount of time with me in person then you know that I'm often very tired. Why is still a mystery to many and trying to fix it is,,, well it hasn't really worked. Especially recently my sleep schedule has been not optimal as no matter how early I go to sleep I only get 4-6h of sleep. Yes, when I go to sleep at midnight i wake up at 5am and when i go to bed at 3am i wake up at around 9am (it's a real problem). So in order to try and fix that I will no londer try to fight it (and force myself to sleep longer when I wake up too early) and just go with it I guess. 

This might be a health issue, I don't know and should probably go to a doctor but eh. I already have trouble falling asleep and I do take medication to help with that, when I should be awake though (in any lesson at school for example) I can fall asleep as if it's the only thing I'm capable of. What's also going to be interesting health wise is how this is going to affect my chronic pain that gets worse during certain times a day. 

How am I going to try and solve this issue you might ask and well do I have the answer for you right here: a biphasic sleep schedule. Now I'm to lazy to explain this all to you so here's the [Wikipedia article about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep) and a summary made by ChatGPT about it:

> Polyphasic sleep is a non-traditional sleep pattern involving multiple short sleep sessions throughout the day and night, replacing the typical single long nighttime sleep. Advocates suggest it can enhance productivity by reducing total sleep time, but its effectiveness and safety remain a subject of debate among experts. While some individuals may adapt to polyphasic sleep, it may not be suitable for everyone, and it's important to consider potential health risks before attempting such sleep schedules.

Now that you've been enlightened as well, here are the things I'm hoping to achieve with this:

* Not being tired all day
* Feeling like I have more freetime
* Being more productive in the time I'm awake
* Living a more fullfilling life

My plan is it to go to sleep right after I get home from school, wake up sometime for dinner and the go to sleep again when I have enough time to make up the 8 hours. This way I can maintain a social life and still try out this little experiment.
